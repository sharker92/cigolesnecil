## How to make dynamic?

Include an API to make this panel dinamic unless you need real time you can implement pub/sub, websocket or other architectures.

## Decisions made
- I took a ton, the most in depht was choosing routes between pages in comparison with the insights tabs to give the user the oportunity to bookmark it.
- Recharts has more features than Chart.js with the disadvantage that isn't compatible with other frameworks.
- I used tailwind, I find it easiert to work with it and more flexible, even those big lines could be annoying.
- Anything else feel free to ask.
